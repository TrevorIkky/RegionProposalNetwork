# RegionProposalNetwork
An end to end fully convolution network for generating region proposals for object detection, instance and semantic segmentation
Used in the Fast-RCNN and Mask-RCNN. Heavily adapted from pytorch's implementation on Fast-RCNN. Includes an example which shows 
how to connect a Feature Pyramid Network's output to a Region Proposal Network.
